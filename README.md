# Primetrade.ai – Data Science Internship Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Data Science internship at Primetrade.ai.
This repository contains my submission for the **Data Science Internship** at **Primetrade.ai**.  
The project analyzes how **crypto trader behavior varies under different market sentiment regimes (Fear vs Greed)** using historical trading data.

## Objective
Analyze the relationship between crypto trader behavior and market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).

## Contents
- `ds_ayush/notebook_1.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with full analysis
- `ds_ayush/csv_files/trader_metrics.csv` – Computed trader performance metrics
- `ds_ayush/outputs/` – Visualizations and charts
- `ds_ayush/ds_report.pdf` – Final summary report with insights
## 📌 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Analyze trader performance under different market sentiment conditions
- Understand how sentiment (Fear vs Greed) impacts profitability and risk
- Identify high-performing and contrarian traders
- Generate insights that can support smarter trading strategies

## 📊 Datasets Used

1. **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index**
   - Daily market sentiment classified as Fear, Extreme Fear, Greed, or Extreme Greed
   - Used to label market conditions

2. **Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)**
   - Trade-level data including:
     - Trader account
     - Trade size
     - Profit & Loss (PnL)
     - Timestamps
   - Used to compute trader performance metrics

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Mapping each trade to the corresponding market sentiment
3. Simplifying sentiment into two regimes: **Fear** and **Greed**
4. Computing trader-level metrics under each regime:
   - Total PnL
   - Win Rate
   - ROI
   - Sharpe Ratio
   - Maximum Drawdown
5. Ranking traders by performance
6. Identifying **contrarian traders** who perform differently across sentiment regimes
7. Visualizing key patterns and insights

## 📈 Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Total PnL**
- **Win Rate**
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**
- **Sharpe Ratio**
- **Maximum Drawdown**
- **Trade Frequency**
- **Contrarian Performance (Fear vs Greed)**
